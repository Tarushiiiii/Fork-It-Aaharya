# Fork-It---Aaharya
Aaharya is a web-based food companion built exclusively for women.
It helps her choose meals that match her hormones, cravings, life stage, and available ingredients — without guilt or restriction.

The Problem :
Most diet apps-
Treat everyone the same
Ignore hormonal cycles
Focus only on calories
Shame cravings
Assume perfect grocery access
Women’s nutritional needs shift across-
Menstrual phases
Pregnancy
Postpartum
Perimenopause and menopause
Yet no food companion truly adapts to this complexity.

The Solution :
Aaharya is a zero-guilt, phase-aware food companion that:
Adapts to menstrual phase and life stage
Keeps preferred flavors (spicy, comforting, tangy)
Suggests smart ingredient swaps
Uses ingredients already in her kitchen
Explains what each meal does for her body
Rewards consistency without shaming

Core Features :
Phase-Aware Nutrition – Supports hormones instead of fighting them
Flavor-First Recipes – Nutrition without sacrificing taste
Smart Swaps – Same comfort, better health impact
Leftover Magic – Reduces food waste and saves money
Explainable Nutrition – Simple, human-friendly insights
Zero-Guilt Framework – Cravings are data, not failure

Uniqueness it holds:
